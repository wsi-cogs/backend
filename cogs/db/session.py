class ContextLocalRegistry(ThreadLocalRegistry):
    """A SQLAlchemy registry, intended to store per-context sessions.

    This is designed to be used with SQLAlchemy's scoped_session, in
    order to avoid sharing a single session between multiple
    asynchronous contexts (since the session is not safe for use in this
    way). It's loosely based upon the existing ScopedRegistry and
    ThreadLocalRegistry, but is compatible with asyncio as well as with
    threaded environments.

    The intended use looks something like this:

    >>> session_factory = sessionmaker(...)
    >>> Session = scoped_session(session_factory)
    >>> Session.registry = ContextLocalRegistry(session_factory)
    >>> # then, in a request:
    >>> session = Session()
    >>> do_database_things(session)
    >>> # the Session can also be used directly, without instantiation:
    >>> Session.query(...).filter(...).all()
    >>> # and at the end of the request (e.g. in a middleware):
    >>> Session.remove()

    Note that it's safe to call `Session.remove()` even if the Session
    hasn't been used in that context, so a middleware that runs after
    every request is an ideal place to do so.

    See the SQLAlchemy documentation for more details:
